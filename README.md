1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.** For example:

    cd Documents/Projects
    ```

3.  **Clone the repository using the `git clone` command:**

    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone. You can find this URL on the repository's page (usually a green "Code" button). It will look something like this:
